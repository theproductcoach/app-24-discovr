Demo Research Data – Candidate Interview Platform

User Interviews – Common Themes:
- “I wasn’t sure what to expect from the assessments.”
- “I left halfway because I didn’t feel like I was making progress.”
- “A personalised plan after the first questions would make me stick around.”
- “The UI was clean, but I got overwhelmed by too many steps.”

Product Feedback:
- 48% of users said they'd return if they received tailored feedback early
- Email reminder with tips had a 23% re-engagement rate
- Users preferred mini-assessments over full-length tests

Usability Issues (Support Tickets):
- 31 users couldn’t restart after partial progress
- Confusion about how many steps remain in the onboarding flow
- Multiple requests to bookmark or ‘save for later’

Behavioural Metrics:
- 67% completion rate when a dashboard is shown after 3 questions
- Without feedback, 52% of users exit before question 5
- When assessment type is explained in onboarding, bounce rate drops by 18%

Hypotheses from PM team:
- Users want instant value (progress tracking or feedback) within 90 seconds
- Providing a "You vs Others" benchmark early boosts engagement
- Delayed onboarding is less effective than fast, learn-as-you-go models

Top Requests from Candidates:
- “Can I see what roles I qualify for right now?”
- “Let me test one thing at a time, not a full suite of skills”
- “Send me feedback even if I don’t finish”
